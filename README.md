### What's this?


A demo for my (Ilija Boshkov's) talk during BeerJS 10 - an intro to 3D and the Web.

A simple scene with switchable environments and customizable models. It's supposed to be a demonstration on how we can have dynamic lighting based on environment maps using physically based rendering to achieve a pleasing result with relative ease.

Plus, it's based on three.js and react-three-fiber to make use of React hooks/components for state management and event handling.


### Live Demo
